    <h3>This app uses your phone's compass reading to determine the directions of your home.</h3>
    <h3>It then uses the ancient art of Feng Shui to determine the layout of your home based on the elements and
        directions.</h3>
    <h3>Sometimes your phone's compass is off so come back and reset it if you need to.</h3>
    <h3>There are 8 Trigrams in the Bagua. Each Trigram represents a different element of nature.</h3>
    <h3>The Trigrams at the top represent Water, Mountain, Thunder, Wind, Fire, Earth, Lake, and Heaven. Moving through
        a creative cycle when going clockwise, or in a destructive cycle when going counter-clockwise </h3>
    <h3>In feng shui the elements feed off of each other water feeds wood, wood feeds fire, fire feeds earth, earth
        feeds metal, metal feeds water. Use your imagination a little but the idea is worth thinking about.</h3>
    <h3>Feng Shui relates to the elements of nature such as fire, water, earth, wood and metal.</h3>
    <h3>Each Trigram is made up of 3 lines. The lines can be broken or unbroken. The broken lines represent Yin energy
        and the unbroken lines represent Yang energy.</h3>
    <h3>Yin energy is feminine, dark, passive, and receptive. Yang energy is masculine, light, active, and projective.
    </h3>
    <h3>Yin and Yang are complimentary to eachother. They are not opposites. They are two sides of the same coin.</h3>
    <h3>Yin and Yang are constantly changing. They are in a state of flux. They are always in motion.</h3>
    <h3>Yin and Yang are always in balance. If one is too strong, the other will be weak. If one is too weak, the other
        will be strong.</h3>
    <h3>Yin and Yang are always in harmony. They are always in agreement. They are always in sync.</h3>

    <h3>The center of your space is considered earth. There are three earth elements in a diagonal line from Southwest
        to Northeast going through the center. It is important to stay grounded. However sometimes you need to look up
        to the heavens or take a swim.</h3>
    <h3>The North is Water. Think about a cool glass of water and a running stream</h3>
    <h3>The North East is Mountain. Think about a mountain that is solid and unmovable</h3>
    <h3>The East is Thunder. Think about a storm that is coming in from the east</h3>
    <h3>The South East is Wind. Think about a gentle breeze that is coming in from the south east</h3>
    <h3>The South is Fire. Think about a warm fire that is burning in the south and think of the sun shining in the
        windows.</h3>
    <h3>The South West is Earth. Think about the earth that is solid and unmovable in the south west</h3>
    <h3>The West is Lake. Think about a lake that is calm and peaceful in the west</h3>
    <h3>The North West is Heaven. Think about the heavens that are above us in the north west</h3>
    <h3>That brings you back to North, water. Also remember the South is Fire (in the northern hemisphere the sun is
        always to our south and the sun is obviously fire, so the sunny parts of your house are usually to the south) so
        notice where the sun comes into
        your house. If you are in the southern hemisphere, where Feng Shui originated, the sun is to the north. We flip
        our compass directions up in the northern hemisphere for Feng Shui because we adapt the rules for up here. It
        takes a while to figure it out but I use the sun as my compass for figuring out the other directions.</h3>
    <h3>The south east </h3>
